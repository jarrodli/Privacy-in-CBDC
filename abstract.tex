\textbf{Abstract.} Central Bank Digital Currencies are an effective means for transacting in an increasingly digital economy. They offer the potential for varying degrees of privacy to both individuals and corporations. In turn, they may also hinder the effective enforcement of illicit activities, including the financing of terrorism and money laundering. This paper explains the technical underpinnings of  privacy in Central Bank Digital Currencies, culminating in an extensive analysis of two case studies. This paper also seeks to draw upon the regulatory environment surrounding Central Bank Digital Currencies so that the conceptual idea of privacy is not divorced from the reality in which it operates.
